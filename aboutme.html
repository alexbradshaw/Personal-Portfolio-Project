    <p class="para1">I am an aspiring student looking to further my career in the coding scene. I was born and raised in Georgia and I've taken a class that covered java decently. I also have been tinkering with computers since i've basically been able to walk. My dad has taught me everything I know and has tried getting me into kitty and other forms of unix. I decided to take the course because I felt like it would allow me to dip my toes into the programming scene and see if it's something I can do as a career.</p>

    <!-- line break cause i couldnt figure out how else to do it -->

    <p class=para2>I haven't had very many programs or really anything to put in my portfolio but I did create a caesar cipher program. I coded the entire program aside from the code that shifts the letter. It took a lot of work including Arrays, Nested if statements, a while loop, and obviously sweat and tears. It is a bit primitive due to the fact I didn't know about functions or methods. I feel I could improve upon it now.</p>
