# Personal-Portfolio-Project

## Description
Why did you build this project?
- To create a portfolio to show off all my work for this course.
What problem does it solve?
- Me not having a portfolio makes it harder to show my worth and skills to a potential employer.
What did you learn?
- Divs can be literally anything
- Html from scratch sucks
- Css sucks even more
- I hate ux/ui
- Can't wait to update this later
